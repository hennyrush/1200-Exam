          The situation is about creating a “perfect” city where everyone will
          ble able to afford casual life, by paying the price of giving away
          personal information. Building an entire neighborhood by digital
          technology infrastructure, including machine learning algorithms,
          means that people living in the part of the city are going to be
          exposed to a constant and permanent monitoring and surveillance by a
          lot of sensors and cameras. The goal of creating a digital city would
          be to optimize every aspect of a “normal” city, which means
          improvements in many different aspects of our daily lives. This case
          is related to our profession in the way that we are the ones that will
          work on implementing many of these changes. We are kind of going to be
          the pioneers of the digital cities.

          <p>
            It is scary to think that our private lives might be endangered Will
            there be a split in the society? What future do digital cities bring
            to our lives and how will our roles alter in the society? Is it a
            waste of time and resources? Are we able to make it work in order to
            prevent the waste? How do we choose who lives in those cities, who
            is eligible and who is not? Is it going to be completely digital,
            only machines that run things around? Will gathering a huge amount
            of data from different sources be more positive or negative for all
            individuals who live in those cities?

        <h3>Three potentially positive aspects of digital cities:</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          <li>
            Gathering and analyzing lot of information from different sources
            such as sensors and smartphones, will make it possible to efficient
            public resources, give possible best solutions to problems, which in
            turn will save resources and develop new ideas.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            More people will be able to get housing, especially now when the
            prices for an apartment are so high. That will give higher quality
            of life and effective lifestyle.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Using information gathered from individuals will increase efficiency
            in providing services to individuals, in many different areas of
            individual lives.

            It is scary to think that someone is going to have such a free pass

            Will this have any outcome on the environment? How will digital

          <h3>Our opinions</h3>
          <p>
            We believe that digital cities might make the society and the city
            worse, and here is why: One one side, the idea of a digital
            “perfectly” optimized city sounds great. Improved health care,
            better services and probably less crime as well as accidents. The
            gathered information might be used to do good, and would maybe
            improve our lives. On the other side, the negative aspects outweigh
            the positive ones. Our private lives would be greatly compromised
            and endangered if something went wrong and someone foul got a hold
            of sensitive information. Another problem is that we minimize the
            social aspects of our lives. If everything is runned by robots, we
            will lose the interactions between humans that occur in simple
            services as shops. Digital cities will then kinda dehumanize us,
            since it will reduce interactions.
