<!--Design-forslag:
            - Annen farge
            - Bilder angående digital cities
            - Lenker, f.eks med hover-effekt. Bilder kan også være lenker.
            - Må se bra ut på alle enheter
            - Subtile animasjoner: Fade-in-effekter for bilder eller tekstblokker når brukeren ruller nedover siden.

    <h1>DATA1100: Digital cities and the welfare state</h1>
    <h2>28. september 2023</h2>
    <p>
      The situation is about creating a “perfect” city where everyone will ble
      able to afford casual life, by paying the price of giving away personal
      information. Building an entire neighborhood by digital technology
      infrastructure, including machine learning algorithms, means that people
      living in the part of the city are going to be exposed to a constant and
      permanent monitoring and surveillance by a lot of sensors and cameras. The
      goal of creating a digital city would be to optimize every aspect of a
      “normal” city, which means improvements in many different aspects of our
      daily lives. This case is related to our profession in the way that we are
      the ones that will work on implementing many of these changes. We are kind
      of going to be the pioneers of the digital cities.
    </p>
    <h3>Immediate reactions</h3>
    <p>
      It is scary to think that our private lives might be endangered Will there
      be a split in the society? What future do digital cities bring to our
      lives and how will our roles alter in the society? Is it a waste of time
      and resources? Are we able to make it work in order to prevent the waste?
      How do we choose who lives in those cities, who is eligible and who is
      not? Is it going to be completely digital, only machines that run things
      around? Will gathering a huge amount of data from different sources be
      more positive or negative for all individuals who live in those cities?
    </p>
    <h3>Three potentially positive aspects of digital cities</h3>
    <p>
      <li>
        Gathering and analyzing lot of information from different sources such
        as sensors and smartphones, will make it possible to efficient public
        resources, give possible best solutions to problems, which in turn will
        save resources and develop new ideas.
      </li>
      <li>
        More people will be able to get housing, especially now when the prices
        for an apartment are so high. That will give higher quality of life and
        effective lifestyle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using information gathered from individuals will increase efficiency in
        providing services to individuals, in many different areas of individual
        lives.
      </li>
    </p>
    <h3>Three potentially negative aspects of digital cities</h3>
    <p>
      <li>
        It is scary to think that someone is going to have such a free pass to
        your personal information. Who will be able to see and manage this
        information, only machines or is there someone else?
      </li>
      <li>
        Will this have any outcome on the environment? How will digital cities
        “act” on the nature? Is there going to be more or less waste, and how is
        the disposal of the waste going to look like?
      </li>
      <li>
        The split between developed/rich countries and the less developed/poor
        countries might become even bigger?
      </li>
    </p>
    <h3>Our opinions</h3>
    <p>
      We believe that digital cities might make the societyand the city worse,
      and here is why: One one side, the idea of a digital “perfectly” optimized
      city sounds great. Improved health care, better services and probably less
      crime as well as accidents. The gathered information might be used to do
      good, and would maybe improve our lives. On the other side, the negative
      aspects outweigh the positive ones. Our private lives would be greatly
      compromised and endangered if something went wrong and someone foul got a
      hold of sensitive information. Another problem is that we minimize the
      social aspects of our lives. If everything is runned by robots, we will
      lose the interactions between humans that occur in simple services as
      shops. Digital cities will then kinda dehumanize us, since it will reduce
      interactions.
