                  The situation is about creating a “perfect” city where everyone will ble
                  able to afford casual life, by paying the price of giving away personal
                  information. Building an entire neighborhood by digital technology
                  infrastructure, including machine learning algorithms, means that people
                  living in the part of the city are going to be exposed to a constant and
                  permanent monitoring and surveillance by a lot of sensors and cameras. The
                  goal of creating a digital city would be to optimize every aspect of a
                  “normal” city, which means improvements in many different aspects of our
                  daily lives. This case is related to our profession in the way that we are
                  the ones that will work on implementing many of these changes. We are kind
                  of going to be the pioneers of the digital cities.

                  <p>
                    It is scary to think that our private lives might be endangered Will
                    there be a split in the society? What future do digital cities bring to
                    our lives and how will our roles alter in the society? Is it a waste of
                    time and resources? Are we able to make it work in order to prevent the
                    waste? How do we choose who lives in those cities, who is eligible and
                    who is not? Is it going to be completely digital, only machines that run
                    things around? Will gathering a huge amount of data from different
                    sources be more positive or negative for all individuals who live in
                    those cities?

                  <h3>Three potentially positive aspects of digital cities</h3>
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      Gathering and analyzing lot of information from different sources such
                      as sensors and smartphones, will make it possible to efficient public
                      resources, give possible best solutions to problems, which in turn
                      will save resources and develop new ideas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      More people will be able to get housing, especially now when the
                      prices for an apartment are so high. That will give higher quality of
                      life and effective lifestyle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Using information gathered from individuals will increase efficiency
                      in providing services to individuals, in many different areas of
                      individual lives.

                      It is scary to think that someone is going to have such a free pass to
                      your personal information. Who will be able to see and manage this

                      Will this have any outcome on the environment? How will digital cities
                      “act” on the nature? Is there going to be more or less waste, and how
                      is the disposal of the waste going to look like?

                  <h3>Our opinions</h3>
                  <p>
                    We believe that digital cities might make the societyand the city worse,
                    and here is why: One one side, the idea of a digital “perfectly”
                    optimized city sounds great. Improved health care, better services and
                    probably less crime as well as accidents. The gathered information might
                    be used to do good, and would maybe improve our lives. On the other
                    side, the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones. Our private lives
                    would be greatly compromised and endangered if something went wrong and
                    someone foul got a hold of sensitive information. Another problem is
                    that we minimize the social aspects of our lives. If everything is
                    runned by robots, we will lose the interactions between humans that
                    occur in simple services as shops. Digital cities will then kinda
                    dehumanize us, since it will reduce interactions.
