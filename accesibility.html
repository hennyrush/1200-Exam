        <br>
        <p>
          The results from the tests on page 1 indicated that our code lacked a meta description. 
          The inclusion of a meta description on the website would contribute to a better overview of the content. 
          Initially, we only had a meta viewport, but following feedback, we added a meta description to the homepage. 
          Furthermore, it was pointed out that the images lacked an explicit specification of width and height; 
          we had only set max-height and min-height. In response, we chose to include both height and width 
          to specify the dimensions. With these changes, we achieved a full score in all aspects except for performance, 
          which still stands at 70.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            We selected color combinations that complemented each other to create a pleasant visual experience. 
            A consistent navigation menu (navbar) was implemented on three of the pages to ensure simple and 
            user-friendly navigation. By utilizing semantic HTML elements in the code, we achieved a universal 
            design that enhances not only readability but also simplifies navigation through the code.

          The results from the Lighthouse accessibility test indicated positive outcomes, achieving a full 
          score in all areas except performance.

        <br>
        <p>
          Simultaneously, the test results provided feedback regarding the website's limited responsiveness to 
          smaller screens. Despite our active efforts to identify and implement solutions for this challenge, 
          we have not yet achieved complete mastery of the issue. We persist in our endeavors to find effective 
          solutions to ensure optimal accessibility and user experience across all devices.

        <h2>Results page 3 "Topical"</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The "Topical" page scored 95 in "Performance," 83 in "Accessibility," 91 in "Best Practices," and 89 
          in "SEO" in our initial test upon completion of the page. Upon closer examination, three main aspects 
          stood out on this page: contrasts, lists, and meta-description.
        </p>
        <br>
         <p>
          The chosen color combinations did not exhibit a sufficient contrast ratio, failing to distinguish 
          themselves adequately. This makes sense, considering we intentionally placed a black (faded) box over 
          the main image on the page to achieve our desired effect. Additionally, several list elements lacked 
          parent elements, such as an "unordered list." Upon scrutinizing our code after this feedback, we identified 
          the absence of several parent elements, which we promptly addressed in multiple instances, retesting the page.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          With these valuable insights and the implemented changes, the results notably improved. "Performance," 
          "Accessibility," and "SEO" scores saw significant enhancements.

          Opportunities for improvement identified in performance focus on image optimization and the 
          elimination of rendering resources that may delay page loading. The accessibility score of 95 
          indicates room for improvement in the contrast ratio between the background and text, which can 
          impact user readability. Nevertheless, we are satisfied with how it currently appears.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Best Practices score of 95 indicates that the website adheres to recommended guidelines, 
          although there are logged browser errors that should be addressed to optimize the user experience. 
          The SEO score of 92 suggests the need to add a meta-description for improved indexing and understanding 
          of the website's content by search engines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Regarding PWA, the page achieves a score of 96, but there is room for improvement related to the
           manifest and installation. These enhancements can contribute to optimizing the user experience, 
           especially for mobile users.
